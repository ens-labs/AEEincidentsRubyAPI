AEEincidentsRubyAPI -> NO LONGER WORKS OR BEING MAINTAINED
================

This is a intermediate API, it connects to a Web Service that AEE has and it transforms that ugly XML into a
beautiful JSON for you to work with.
Link: https://aeeapi.herokuapp.com/api/

Requirements
=============
1. Ruby 2.6.0
2. Sinatra
3. Savon
4. or just: **bundle install**

Endpoints
===========

The API has 3 main endpoints, at the moment the app does not serve any HTML or anything like that.

1. This endpoint gives you a list of the pueblos and the number of averia they have at the moment.
	* **localhost:4567/api/lista.json**
2. This endpoint gives you the data for a specific pueblo. Just replace the **comment** for a pueblo.
	* **localhost:4567/api/pueblo_especifico.json?pueblo=HERE_GOES_A_PUEBLO**  
	* Example: **localhost:4567/api/pueblo_especifico.json?pueblo=san juan**.
	* BTW, it can read pueblos with space. Example: aguas buenas, san juan, trujillo alto etc..
3. This endpoint gives you all the pueblos with all the averias and their information. All the information, we can say.
	* **localhost:4567/api/all_averias.json**
