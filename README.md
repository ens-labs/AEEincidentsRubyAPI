AEEincidentsRubyAPI
================

This is a intermediate API, it connects to a Web Service that AEE has and it transforms that ugly XML into a 
beautiful JSON for you to work with.

Requirements
=============
1. Ruby 1.9.3
2. Sinatra
3. Savon
4. or just: **bundle install**

Endpoints
===========

The API has 3 main endpoints, at the moment the app does not serve any HTML or anything like that.

1. The first one is: **localhost:4567/api/lista.json**, this endpoints gives you a list of the pueblos with data at the moment.
2. The second one is: **localhost:4567/api/pueblo_especifico.json?pueblo=HERE_GOES_A_PUEBLO**, this endpoints gives you the data 
for a specific pueblo. Just replace the text for a pueblo. Example: **localhost:4567/api/pueblo_especifico.json?pueblo=san juan**. BTW, it can read pueblos with space. Example: aguas buenas, san juan, trujillo alto etc..
3. The Third one is: **localhost:4567/api/all_averias.json**, this endpoint gives you all the pueblos with all the averias. All the information, we can say.

Work in Progress
=================
The endpoint **localhost:4567/api/pueblo_especifico.json** needs some organization with the data, so Work in progress.
